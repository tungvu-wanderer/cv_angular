# CvAngular

## Live demo

A live version of this repo is available at:
1. [https://cv.tungvu.uk](https://cv.tungvu.uk)
2. [https://tungvu-wanderer.github.io/cv_angular](https://tungvu-wanderer.github.io/cv_angular)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Deployment

A Github Actions workflow is available, using [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-angular-to-github-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-angular-to-github-pages) which will publish a Github Page at `https://[github_username].github.io/[github_repo]/`
